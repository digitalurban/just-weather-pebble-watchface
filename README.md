## Technical Details

This project consists of two main parts:

1.  **The Watch Face (C):** The native application that runs on the Pebble watch. It is responsible for displaying the UI, managing the layout, and updating the time.
2.  **The Companion App (JavaScript):** A JavaScript application that runs on the connected smartphone. It is responsible for fetching location data and making API calls to get weather information, which it then sends to the watch.

## How to Configure Settings

Access the settings page through your Pebble app or by long-pressing the select button on your watch:

* **Temperature Units:** Choose between Celsius (¬∞C) and Fahrenheit (¬∞F)
* **Wind Speed Units:** Select mph or km/h for wind speed display
* **Precipitation Units:** Pick millimeters (mm) or inches (in) for rainfall measurements
* **Hourly Vibration:** Enable or disable gentle vibration alerts at the top of each hour

All changes take effect immediately - no need to restart the app!

### APIs Used

* **Weather Data:** [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) - Provides current weather conditions, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and precipitation data
* **Reverse Geocoding:** [Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) - Converts GPS coordinates to human-readable location names with high accuracy

## Project Structure

* `src/c/just_weather.c`: The main C source file for the watch face UI and logic.
* `src/pkjs/app.js`: The companion JavaScript app for fetching data.
* `package.json`: Contains project metadata, dependencies, and Pebble-specific settings, such as the app's UUID and target platforms.
* `wscript`: The Python-based build script used by the Pebble SDK to compile and bundle the application.
* `js/message_keys.json`: Defines the keys used for communication between the watch and the phone.

## How to Build

To build and run this watch face, you will need to have the Pebble SDK installed and configured in your environment.

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    pebble build
    ```

2.  **Install on an emulator (e.g., Basalt):**
    ```bash
    pebble install --emulator basalt
    ```
3.  **View logs:**
    To see logs from both the C application and the JavaScript companion app, run:
    ```bash
    pebble logs
    ```
